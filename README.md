This implementation generally follows the style in [these Theano
tutorials](https://github.com/Newmu/Theano-Tutorials) but loads all the training
data onto the GPU as in [other examples](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/code/logistic_sgd.py). See also
an earlier [VAE implementation](https://github.com/y0ast/Variational-Autoencoder).
